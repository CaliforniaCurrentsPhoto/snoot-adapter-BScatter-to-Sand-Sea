# snoot-adapter-BScatter-to-Sand-Sea
This is a 3d printable part to use a Backscatter Optical Snoot 1 on a Sea and Sea YS-D3 strobe. You will need to have the file printed (under 20 US), marine epoxy,
and a Sea and Sea YS-D3 snoot. Essentially you epoxy on the 3d pritned part onto the YS-D3 base. It works great and the focus light on the YS-D3 workes great for aiming.
